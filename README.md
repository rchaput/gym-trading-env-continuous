Gym Trading Env is an Gymnasium environment for simulating stocks and training Reinforcement Learning (RL) trading agents.
It was designed to be fast and customizable for easy RL trading algorithms implementation.

*Gym Trading Env Continuous* is a fork that uses continuous actions by default;
it includes a wrapper that allows using discrete actions exactly as in the
original Gym Trading Env. Everything else should work the same, and the original
documentation should be useful as well.
